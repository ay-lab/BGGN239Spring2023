## Overview
Bioinformatics - Bioinformatics is conceptualizing biology in terms of macromolecules and then applying "informatics" techniques derived from disciplines such as applied mathematics, computer science, and statistics to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules, on a large-scale

This (add number of units) course is dedicated to teach bioinformatics with a specific focus on its applications to important problems in immunology through practical and hands-on training likely to impact students' overall success in their research.

#Please modify base on the course content
An integrated lecture/lab structure with hands-on exercises and small-scale projects emphasizes modern developments in genomics and proteomics. A detailed listing of all [lecture topics]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures/) is available and includes the major areas of: 

- Genomic and biomolecular bioinformatic resources, 
- Advances in sequencing technologies, 
- Genome informatics, 
- Structural informatics, 
- Transcriptomics, and 
- Bioinformatics data analysis with R.  

 Students completing this course will be able to apply leading existing bioinformatics tools to address biological questions. Our broader goal is to point towards perspectives that bioinformatics can expose for the integration and analysis of complex biological information. For further details please see our complete list of [course objectives and specific learning goals]({{ site.baseurl }}/goals/).

## Audience: 
Biology majors with upper division standing. A familiarity with basic biomedical concepts is essential (students should have successfully completed BILD1 and BILD4 or BIMM 101). No formal programming training or high level mathematical skills are required.  

## Accessibility:  
We are committed to making this course accessible to everybody. Please contact Prof. Ferhat <fay@health.ucsd.edu> if you have questions regarding room accessibility.  

#Please complete base on the guidelines
## Requirements: 
To fully participate in this course students will be expected to use their own laptop computers with specific freely available [software installed]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/). A limited number of classroom computers are also available should the need arise. Participants must bring a laptop with specific [software installed]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/).
